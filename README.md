# Introduction

**_Amauta_** focuses on fulfilling the need to create maintainable, redable and intuitive documentation. It defines a new protocol to declare documentation for RESTful APIs, marked-up content, SDKs and virtually anything that could be used in a collaborative team, open source tools or personal projects. 

# Content

## Protocol

**_Amauta_** defines a completely new way to declare the different pieces that exist in a documentation, covering syntax features that are expected from a regular documenation generator, but with simplicity and ease of use.

<details>
  <summary>üü¢ What Amauta wants you to write</summary>

  ```
  [[Users@api#public,internal]]
group: api
summary: Endpoints related to user operations

[request@POST:/v1/users]
summary: Create a new user  
contentType: application/json  

header@object: This is the root @object description  
header.Authorization@str#internal: Bearer token. This is only the field's description

body@object: This is the @object root description  
body.profile@user_profile: Main user information. This field references a non-native type "@user_profile", to be searched within the linting scope.  
body.metadata@object: Tracking info. Below, it defines each of their fields
body.metadata.source?str#internal: Origin of signup.
body.metadata.labels?str[]#internal: Internal labels  
body.metadata.status@enum[active,inactive,archived]|null#deprecated: User status

example: <ref@example:create_user>

[ref@schema:user_profile]
name@str: User's name  
email@str: User's email  
timezone@custom:datetime: User's timezone. Defines a custom type, linted normally as wildcard to give the writer flexibility.

[ref@example:create_user]
profile.name: Jane Doe  
profile.email: jane@example.com  
profile.gender: female  
metadata.source: newsletter  
metadata.tags: [beta, test]

  ```

Focusing on simplicity and readability, **_Amauta_** avoids a nested/indented syntax. Some repetition to access inner fields might be encountered, while encouraging separate modular definitions on more complex entities.

## Linter/Renderer
Documenting expects to export a final page that is both professional and easy to navigate. Being honest, there are plenty platforms that do this quiet well, [after](https://www.dreamfactory.com/) you [click](https://redocly.com/) the "[talk to sales team](https://scalar.com/)" button [of course](https://stoplight.io/).
From a FOSS point of view, most alternatives to render a doc manifest into a web page to present, most solutions lack a lean, professional interface. **_Amauta_** is also improving this by providing a responsive product that uses a simplified but elegant look.
